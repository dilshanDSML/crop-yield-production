# Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning 🌾

This project predicts crop yield using machine learning techniques.
It includes data preprocessing, model training, and exploratory
data analysis (EDA).

The project was developed as part of my learning journey in
Data Science and Machine Learning.

## Project Overview

The workflow of this project includes:
- Data preprocessing using a saved preprocessing pipeline
- Training a Decision Tree Regression model
- Generating an EDA report for data understanding
- Saving trained artifacts for reuse

---

## Dataset

- File: `yield_df.csv`
- The dataset contains agricultural data used for training
  and evaluating the model.

---

## Machine Learning Artifacts

The following trained files are included:

- `model.pkl` – trained Decision Tree Regression model
- `preprocessor.pkl` – preprocessing pipeline
- `eda_report.html` – exploratory data analysis report

These files are generated programmatically and reused for prediction.
